            We love the Ruby programming language. In fact, we love it so much that we want to share it with you in a day-long Ruby Camp! In under a day, you’ll participate in a hands-on workshop where you’ll build and deploy a couple of web applications, using HTML5 and some Ruby web frameworks.
          %p
            We'll provide food and refreshments throughout the day as well. 
          
          %p
            We’ll even help you get your machine ready before we start. All you have to do is bring a laptop.
            
          %p
            We're aiming this at developers who have even basic knowledge of Java, .Net, PHP, and ColdFusion, and we'll be ready to answer your questions about Ruby. Also, we welcome any new programmers, students, and those new to web development.
